**Technologies Used :**  

**Flutter**: Cross-platform UI framework.  
**Riverpod**: State management for predictable and testable app behavior.  
**Firebase Authentication**: Secure user authentication and session management.  
**SharedPreferences**: Local storage for persisting user favorites.  
**HTTP**: API integration for product data fetching.  

**Challenges Faced**
1. Persistent State Management  
Managing the state of user favorites across app sessions required careful integration of SharedPreferences with Riverpod. Ensuring data synchronization between local storage and the app state was a key challenge.  
  
2. Firebase Authentication
Integrating Firebase Authentication with Riverpod to handle secure login/logout and session persistence posed initial difficulties, particularly ensuring seamless navigation between authenticated and non-authenticated screens.  

3. Profile Data Handling  
Implementing editable profile fields without losing entered data during widget rebuilds was tricky. This was resolved by using TextEditingController effectively and saving data on explicit user actions.  

4. Navigation & State  
Coordinating navigation between multiple screens while maintaining state consistency required careful planning, especially with deep links and back navigation behavior.
